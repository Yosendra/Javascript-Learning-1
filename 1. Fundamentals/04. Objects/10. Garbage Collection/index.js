// In low level language like C and C++, we need manually allocate a memory and also deallocate the memory
// In javascript there is no need to do that because we have 'Garbage Collector'

let circle = {}         // this allocate a memory
console.log(circle);

// end of execution, all memory allocated will be released automatically by 'Garbage Collector'
