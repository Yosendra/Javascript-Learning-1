These tools are important if you are building browser application, if you are using Javascript in Node
you don't have to worry of these tools.

When using modern Javscript we need two kinds of tools: Transpiler & Bundler.
○ Transpiler -> Tranlator + Compiler
    It is a tool to convert modern javascript syntax into a code which all the browser can understand
    Babel is the example of this.

○ Bundler
    or Module Bundler is responsible for combining all our Javascript files into a single file,
    which we call a bundle. Webpack is one of popular bundler. We give all our Javascript files
    to Webpack, Webpack will combine them into a single file. It will minify our code by getting
    rid of all the white space and comments, and it will uglify the code to shorten the identifiers
    (class, function, object, etc). It will reduce the size of the bundle.
